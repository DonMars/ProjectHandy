Thank you for downloading this Vr Games Dev package.

The Unity Asset Store policy requires that all packages provide basic local
documentation, which is what you will find in the:
Assets/_VrGamesDev/Documentation folder.

1) You need to install the following packages before using this package in this:
a.- com.unity.remote-config | Remote Config | Version 4.0.0 - November 03, 2023

If you have DDuA Installed:
b.- com.unity.addressables | Addressables | Version 1.19.19 - March 04, 2022

2) You can learn how to install them and custom them in your own products
reading the file "Manual.pdf" inside the Package folder inside
the documentation folder

3) To use the API, unzip the files and open the index.html in a regular browser

However, we strongly suggest using the online manual, which is more complete
and up-to-date. The PDF documentation is rarely updated.
You can check the current documentation online at:
